`ia_books.json` is a list of all books on Open Library linked to digitized archive.org editions

```
curl 'http://localhost:8984/solr/openlibrary/export?q=type%3Aedition+AND+isbn%3A*+AND+ia%3A*&wt=json&fl=key,isbn,ia&sort=key+asc' > tmp.json
```

`main.py` is a web driving script to pull ~250K html book records from catalog.midcolumbialibraries.org/polaris into `midcolumbialibraries.txt`

`parse.py` is a script that marshals the html in `midcolumbialibraries.txt`, created by main.py, into `midcolumbia_books.jsonl`

`mc_isbns.json` is a raw list of isbns found `midcolumbia_books.jsonl`, generated by the parse:

```
with open('midcolumbia_books.jsonl') as fin:
     import json
     isbns = set()
     for line in fin:
         isbn = json.loads(line).get('ISBN')
         if isbn:
             isbns.add(isbn)

with open('mc_isbns.json', 'w') as fout:
     json.dump(list(isbns), fout)
```

The final step is to overlap the isbns in `mc_isbns.json` with those in `ia_books.json`
